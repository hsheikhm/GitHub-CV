Having just graduated I feel that I have learnt more in these last 4 months than I did in my whole time at university and during my career. Thanks to Makers Academy, I now have a huge passion for not only software programming and design but also for working within a team in an agile manner.\r\n\r\nYou can read my [blog](https://hsheikhm.wordpress.com/) to see just how much I have enjoyed learning how to code.\r\n\r\n## Code Examples\r\n\r\n#### [**1) 'Changr' iOS App & Beacons - Swift**](https://github.com/hsheikhm/changr)\r\n\r\n  * ***Description:***\r\n  iOS app built in just 2 weeks. It allows people to donate to the homeless using beacons.\r\n  * ***Technologies:***\r\n  Built in Swift, the app is used with Estimote beacons so that a donor can receive a custom notification on their phone when they walk past a homeless person. It is further connected to a Firebase database.\r\n  * ***Successes:***\r\n  Built an iOS app with no previous experience and learnt a new language, Swift in just 2 weeks. We customised the behaviour of beacons. Learnt how to build and style an app in Xcode.\r\n\r\n[*View App Screenshots*](https://hsheikhm.wordpress.com/2016/01/10/final-project-complete-changr/) | [*View Video Demo*](https://youtu.be/AyVZJ511cqI?t=96)\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n#### [**2) Daily Review App  - Angular JS**](https://github.com/hsheikhm/daily_review_app)\r\n\r\n  * ***Description:***\r\n  Students at Makers Academy fill in a daily feedback form in order to submit their feelings to coaches.\r\n  * ***Technologies:***\r\n  Website is built in Angular JS and styled beautifully with HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. It is also connected to a Firebase database to keep data real-time.\r\n  * ***Successes:***\r\n  The app is the first project from students to be taken forward by the Academy. It was only built in 3 days. We created our very own Slackbot in just 1 day. It clearly demonstrates the benefits of using Angular JS.\r\n\r\n[*View Website*](https://shining-fire-9962.firebaseapp.com/#/) | [*View Styling*](https://hsheikhm.wordpress.com/2015/12/12/week-13-shef-devs/)\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n#### [**3) Chitter Web App - Ruby**](https://github.com/hsheikhm/chitter-challenge)\r\n\r\n  * ***Description:***\r\n  Built a clone of Twitter over a weekend. Users can sign up, post a message and view all messages.\r\n  * ***Technologies:***\r\n  Built in Ruby, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. All users and messages are stored via DataMapper.\r\n  * ***Successes:***\r\n  The app is completely tested with RSpec in terms of feature and unit tests. It is built within a Sinatra framework and has a stylish front-end.\r\n\r\n[*View Website*](http://welcome-to-chitter.herokuapp.com/signup) | [*View Styling*](https://hsheikhm.wordpress.com/2015/11/11/week-8-building-databases/)\r\n\r\n## Technical Skills and Technologies\r\n\r\n|                    | Strong                                                     | Know                       |\r\n| ------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------- |\r\n| **Languages**      | Ruby, Javascript, HTML, CSS                                | jQuery, Swift              |\r\n| **Databases/ORMS** | PostGresQL, DataMapper, Firebase                           | MongoDB                    |\r\n| **Frameworks**     | Sinatra, Ruby on Rails, Angular JS, Bootstrap              | Node JS                    |\r\n| **Testing**        | RSpec, Jasmine, Capybara                                   | Karma, Protractor, XCTest  |\r\n| **Other**          | GitHub version control, Agile processes, Refactoring code  | Heroku deployment          |\r\n\r\n## Education\r\n\r\n#### Makers Academy *(October 2015 - January 2016)*\r\n\r\nA highly selective 12 week intensive coding bootcamp.\r\n\r\nGained experience in:\r\n* Pair programming, TDD/BDD, Agile practices.\r\n* OOP, software design, full stack web development.\r\n* Git version control, working in a team.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n#### Royal Holloway, University of London *(2009 - 2014)*\r\nBA European Studies (German) - 2.1\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n#### Wellington College *(2004 - 2009)*\r\nA Levels: French, German and Economics\r\n\r\n## Work Experience\r\n\r\n**Sales, Marketing & Programmes Coordinator** | BUNAC (STA Travel) | November 2013 - July 2015 | London\r\n<br/>Increased customers by 30% and brought on 10 new clients.
