============
Currently seeking a Junior Web Developer role in London.

Recently changed careers to focus all my energy and time in learning to code at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/). Having just graduated I feel that I have learnt more in these last 4 months then I did in my whole time at university and during my career. Thanks to Makers Academy, I now have a huge passion for software programming and design and working part of a team in an agile manner.

You can read my [blog](https://hsheikhm.wordpress.com/) to see just how much I have enjoyed learning how to code.

Read my code on [GitHub](https://github.com/hsheikhm)
