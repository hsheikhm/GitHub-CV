============
Currently seeking a Junior Web Developer role in London.

Recently changed careers to focus all my energy and time in learning to code at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/). Having just graduated I feel that I have learnt more in these last 4 months then I did in my whole time at university and during my career. Thanks to Makers, I now have a huge passion for software programming and design and working part of a team in an agile manner.

You can read my [blog](https://hsheikhm.wordpress.com/) to see just how much I have enjoyed learning how to code.

Read my code on [GitHub](https://github.com/hsheikhm)

Users can sign up, post a message and view all messages from other users. Users and messages are stored in SQL database, DataMapper.|

Web Development
---------------
Ever since I started to learn how to code at Makers Academy I haven't stopped having fun. Since I didn't come from any previous technology experience I was very eager to learn how to build applications and I have to say that it is now become my biggest passion.

I love building applications in order to solve problems. More importantly, I enjoy working as part of a team on one problem so that we can break it down into several problems and solve each one individually i.e. doing the Agile approach.
