Currently seeking a Junior Web Developer role.

Recently changed careers to focus all my energy and time in learning to code at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/). Having just graduated I feel that I have learnt more in these last 4 months than I did in my whole time at university and during my career. Thanks to Makers Academy, I now have a huge passion for not only software programming and design but also for working within a team in an agile manner.

You can read my [blog](https://hsheikhm.wordpress.com/) to see just how much I have enjoyed learning how to code.

## Code Examples

#### [**1) 'Changr' iOS App & Beacons - Swift**](https://github.com/hsheikhm/changr)

  * ***Description:***
  iOS app built in just 2 weeks. It allows people to donate to the homeless using beacons.
  * ***Technologies:***
  Built in Swift, the app is used with Estimote beacons so that a donor can receive a custom notification on their phone when they walk past a homeless person. It is further connected to a Firebase database.
  * ***Successes:***
  Built an iOS app with no previous experience and learnt a new language, Swift in just 2 weeks. We customised the behaviour of beacons. Learnt how to build and style an app in Xcode.

#### [**2) Daily Review App  - Angular JS**](https://github.com/hsheikhm/daily_review_app)

  * ***Description:***
  Students at Makers Academy fill in a daily feedback form in order to submit their feelings to coaches.
  * ***Technologies:***
  Website is built in Angular JS and styled beautifully with HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. It is also connected to a Firebase database to keep data real-time.
  * ***Successes:***
  The app is the first project from students to be taken forward by the Academy. It was only built in 3 days. We created our very own Slackbot in just 1 day. It clearly demonstrates the benefits of using Angular JS.
