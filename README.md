============
I'm currently seeking a Junior Web Developer role in London. I have enjoyed spending the past several months at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) building applications with many different technologies. Read my code on [GitHub](https://github.com/hsheikhm).

Code Examples
-------------

| [Changr iOS App](https://github.com/hsheikhm/changr)| [Daily Review Web App](https://github.com/hsheikhm/daily_review_app)| [Chitter Web App](https://github.com/hsheikhm/chitter-challenge)  |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----- |
|Swift app built within a team in just 2 weeks. It allows people to donate to homeless people using PayPal API. It is used with Estimote Beacons so that a donor can receive a notification on their iPhone when walking past a homeless person.| Students at Makers Academy fill in a daily review form, which gets stored on a Firebase database. Findings are displayed for coaches on an Angular JS front-end so that they can understand how students are feeling. Built in 3 days.| Built a clone of Twitter over a weekend using Ruby, HTML & CSS. Users can sign up, post a message and view all messages from other users. Users and messages are stored in SQL database, DataMapper.|

Web Development
---------------
Ever since I started to learn how to code at Makers Academy I haven't stopped having fun. Since I didn't come from any previous technology experience I was very eager to learn how to build applications and I have to say that it is now become my biggest passion.

I love building applications in order to solve problems. More importantly, I enjoy working as part of a team on one problem so that we can break it down into several problems and solve each one individually i.e. doing the Agile approach.
